Dilluting my work day with frequent minor breaks is important to me, because if I don't give myself periodic breaks I have a tendency to work myself into a frenzy which leaves me feeling tired and sometimes stressed.

Most are well-familiar with the Pomodoro technique which divides the work day into 25 minute focused-work segments separated by 5 minute breaks, and every couple cycles a 15-ish minute long break.

## The Problem

I am a fan of this but find it to be too restrictive. If I only have time in my day between meetings for a long break earlier in the morning, I can't wait for the 4-5 cycles to pass for my long break to happen. I won't get one if I try to follow those constraints.

And 5 minute breaks can leave you feeling like you're waiting for the shift bell to buzz and begin working like a drone bee again.

## My Approach

I have over time made my own variation for personal practice. It's simple enough that maybe it's not worth even writing about. But I did have some people interested in my approach so you're stuck reading this. I like to call it "pomodorino" because Google tells me that is the word for a small tomato (where pomodoro is the name for a normal tomato). It's a cute name at least.

The idea is that 25-minute work segments: good. You are never looking at an afternoon with dread, because you know it'll be broken up into very approachable work segments. 

The 5 minute break... eh. Somewhere close to that. Don't set a timer, just get up and walk around a bit. Maybe around the building. Or maybe take care of some personal business, respond to some texts. It's up to you. It doesn't feel like much of a break if you're eyeing a clock the entire time.

Where to place the long breaks? Just at any point in each half of your work day, once before lunch and once after lunch for 15-20 minutes each. I like to go on walks for mine to get my daily 7k steps but to each their own. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to die if I don't get enough sunshine in a day. Offices can feel very oppressive, the sterile light and clinical clean workspaces. But I do like talking to the people.

## Let's Summarize
* 25 minute work session
* 5-10 minute break (not timed!!)
* Repeat the above two steps in all the time you have
* 15-20 minute long break sometime in each half of the day
